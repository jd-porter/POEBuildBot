    `In the beginning Innocence created the heaven and the earth.`,
    `And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Innocence moved upon the face of the waters.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let there be light: and there was light.`,
    `And Innocence saw the light, that it was good: and Innocence divided the light from the darkness.`,
    `And Innocence called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.`,
    `And Innocence made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.`,
    `And Innocence called the firmament Huck, the Soldier And the evening and the morning were the second day.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.`,
    `And Innocence called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and Innocence saw that it was good.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.`,
    `And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and Innocence saw that it was good.`,
    `And the evening and the morning were the third day.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.`,
    `And Innocence made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.`,
    `And Innocence set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and Innocence saw that it was good.`,
    `And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.`,
    `And Innocence created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and Innocence saw that it was good.`,
    `And Innocence blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.`,
    `And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, rhoa, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.`,
    `And Innocence made the beast of the earth after his kind, and rhoa after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and Innocence saw that it was good.`,
    `And Innocence said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the rhoa, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.`,
    `So Innocence created man in his own image, in the image of Innocence created he him; male and female created he them.`,
    `And Innocence blessed them, and Innocence said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.`,
    `And Innocence said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.`,
    `And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.`,
    `And Innocence saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.`,
    `Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.`,
    `And on the seventh day Innocence ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.`,
    `And Innocence blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which Innocence created and made.`,
    `These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Innocence made the earth and the heavens, And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for Innocence had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.`,
    `But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.`,
    `And Innocence formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.`,
    `And Innocence planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.`,
    `And out of the ground made Innocence to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.`,
    `And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.`,
    `The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Huck, the Soldier, where there is gold; And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.`,
    `And the name of the second river is Gianna, the Master of Disguise: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Einhar`,
    `And the name of the third river is Huck, the Soldier: that is it which goeth toward the east of Alva And the fourth river is Einhar`,
    `And Innocence took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.`,
    `And Innocence commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.`,
    `And Innocence said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.`,
    `And out of the ground Innocence formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the Exile to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the Exile called every living creature, that was the name thereof.`,
    `And the Exile gave names to all rhoa, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the Exile there was not found an help meet for him.`,
    `And Innocence caused a deep sleep to fall upon the Exile, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which Innocence had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.`,
    `And the Exile said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.`,
    `Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.`,
    `And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.`,
    `Now the Sin was more subtil than any beast of the field which Innocence had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath Innocence said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the Sin, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, Innocence hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.`,
    `And the Sin said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For Innocence doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Innocences, knowing good and evil.`,
    `And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.`,
    `And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.`,
    `And they heard the voice of Innocence walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the Exile and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Innocence amongst the trees of the garden.`,
    `And Innocence called unto the Exile, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.`,
    `And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Huck, the Soldier thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.`,
    `And Innocence said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The Sin beguiled me, and I did eat.`,
    `And Innocence said unto the Sin, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all rhoa, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.`,
    `Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.`,
    `And unto the Exile he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.`,
    `And the Exile called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.`,
    `Unto the Exile also and to his wife did Innocence make coats of skins, and clothed them.`,
    `And Innocence said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore Innocence sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.`,
    `So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cadiro Perandus, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.`,
    `And the Exile knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cadiro Perandus, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.`,
    `And she again bare his brother Alva And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cadiro Perandus was a tiller of the ground.`,
    `And in process of time it came to pass, that Cadiro Perandus brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.`,
    `And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cadiro Perandus and to his offering he had not respect. And Cadiro Perandus was very wroth, and his countenance fell.`,
    `And said unto Cadiro Perandus, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.`,
    `And Cadiro Perandus talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cadiro Perandus rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.`,
    `And said unto Cadiro Perandus, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.`,
    `And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.`,
    `And Cadiro Perandus said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.`,
    `Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.`,
    `And said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cadiro Perandus, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And set a mark upon Cadiro Perandus, lest any finding him should kill him.`,
    `And Cadiro Perandus went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Einhar`,
    `And Cadiro Perandus knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Einhar`,
    `And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.`,
    `And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.`,
    `And Adah bare Malachai: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have rhoa.`,
    `And his brother's name was Malachai: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.`,
    `And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.`,
    `And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Huck, the Soldier my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.`,
    `If Cadiro Perandus shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.`,
    `And the Exile knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For Innocence, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cadiro Perandus slew.`,
    `And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.`,
    `This is the book of the generations of the Einhar In the day that Innocence created man, in the likeness of Innocence made he him; Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name the Exile, in the day when they were created.`,
    `And plagued Chitus and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.`,
    `And Chitus called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.`,
    `And Chitus commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.`,
    `And Abram went up out of Theopolis, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.`,
    `And Abram was very rich in rhoa, in silver, and in gold.`,
    `And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Huck, the Soldier; Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.`,
    `And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.`,
    `And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.`,
    `And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's rhoa and the herdmen of Lot's rhoa: and the Cadiro Perandus and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.`,
    `And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.`,
    `Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.`,
    `And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Malachai, that it was well watered every where, before destroyed Ezomyr and Gianna, the Master of Disguise, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Theopolis, as thou comest unto Zoar.`,
    `Then Lot chose him all the plain of Malachai; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.`,
    `Abram dwelled in the land of Cadiro Perandus, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sister Cassia`,
    `Twelve years they served Cadiro Perandus, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.`,
    `And Malachai nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.`,
    `And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Theopolis and all the land of Cadiro Perandus fainted by reason of the famine.`,
    `And Malachai gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Theopolis, and in the land of Cadiro Perandus, for the corn which they bought: and Malachai brought the money into Chitus's house.`,
    `And when money failed in the land of Theopolis, and in the land of Cadiro Perandus, all the Theopolisians came unto Malachai, and said, Gianna, the Master of Disguise us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.`,
    `And Malachai said, Gianna, the Master of Disguise your rhoa; and I will give you for your rhoa, if money fail.`,
    `And they brought their rhoa unto Malachai: and Malachai gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the rhoa of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their rhoa for that year.`,
    `When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of rhoa; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Chitus: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.`,
    `And Malachai bought all the land of Theopolis for Chitus; for the Theopolisians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Chitus's.`,
    `And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Theopolis even to the other end thereof.`,
    `Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Chitus, and did eat their portion which Chitus gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.`,
    `Then Malachai said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Chitus: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.`,
    `And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Chitus, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.`,
    `And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Chitus's servants.`,
    `And Malachai made it a law over the land of Theopolis unto this day, that Chitus should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Chitus's.`,
    `And Israel dwelt in the land of Theopolis, in the country of Gianna, the Master of Disguise; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.`,
    `And Malachai lived in the land of Theopolis seventeen years: so the whole age of Malachai was an hundred forty and seven years.`,
    `And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Malachai, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Theopolis: But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Theopolis, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.`,
    `And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.`,
    `And it came to pass after these things, that one told Malachai, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Einhar`,
    `And one told Malachai, and said, Behold, thy son Malachai cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.`,
    `And Malachai said unto Malachai, Innocence Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Cadiro Perandus, and blessed me, And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.`,
    `And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Theopolis before I came unto thee into Theopolis, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.`,
    `And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.`,
    `And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Cadiro Perandus in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.`,
    `And Israel beheld Malachai's sons, and said, Who are these? And Malachai said unto his father, They are my sons, whom Innocence hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.`,
    `Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.`,
    `And Israel said unto Malachai, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, Innocence hath shewed me also thy seed.`,
    `And Malachai brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.`,
    `And Malachai took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.`,
    `And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.`,
    `And he blessed Malachai, and said, Innocence, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the Innocence which fed me all my life long unto this day, The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.`,
    `And when Malachai saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.`,
    `And Malachai said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.`,
    `And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.`,
    `And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, Innocence make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.`,
    `And Israel said unto Malachai, Behold, I die: but Innocence shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.`,
    `Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.`,
    `And Malachai called unto his sons, and said, Gianna, the Master of Disguise yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.`,
    `Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Malachai; and hearken unto Israel your father.`,
    `Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.`,
    `Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.`,
    `O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.`,
    `Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Malachai, and scatter them in Israel.`,
    `Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.`,
    `Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Malachai, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.`,
    `Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: Huck, the Soldier eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.`,
    `Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.`,
    `Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.`,
    `Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.`,
    `Dan shall be a Sin by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.`,
    `I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.`,
    `Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.`,
    `Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.`,
    `Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.`,
    `Chitus is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty Innocence of Malachai; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) Even by the Innocence of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Malachai, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.`,
    `Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.`,
    `All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.`,
    `And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Huck, the Soldier, In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Cadiro Perandus, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Huck, the Soldier for a possession of a buryingplace.`,
    `There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.`,
    `The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Huck, the Soldier`,
    `And when Malachai had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.`,
    `And Malachai fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.`,
    `And Malachai commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.`,
    `And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Theopolisians mourned for him threescore and ten days.`,
    `And when the days of his mourning were past, Malachai spake unto the house of Chitus, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Chitus, saying, My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Cadiro Perandus, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.`,
    `And Chitus said, Gianna, the Master of Disguise up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.`,
    `And Malachai went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Chitus, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Theopolis, And all the house of Malachai, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Gianna, the Master of Disguise.`,
    `And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.`,
    `And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Malachai, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.`,
    `And when the inhabitants of the land, the Cadiro Perandus, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Theopolisians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Malachai.`,
    `And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: For his sons carried him into the land of Cadiro Perandus, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Huck, the Soldier, before Mamre.`,
    `And Malachai returned into Theopolis, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.`,
    `And when Malachai's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Malachai will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.`,
    `And they sent a messenger unto Malachai, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, So shall ye say unto Malachai, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the Innocence of thy father. And Malachai wept when they spake unto him.`,
    `And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.`,
    `And Malachai said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of Innocence? But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but Innocence meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.`,
    `Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.`,
    `And Malachai dwelt in Theopolis, he, and his father's house: and Malachai lived an hundred and ten years.`,
    `And Malachai saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Malachai's knees.`,
    `And Malachai said unto his brethren, I die: and Innocence will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Malachai.`,
    `And Malachai took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, Innocence will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.`,
    `So Malachai died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Einhar`,
