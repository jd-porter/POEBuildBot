    `Kirac's my name, tracker and officer in Oriath's new Citizen Vanguard.`,
    `We're the front line, ensuring the likes of Kitava and Innocence never blindside us again.`,
    `The Templar kept the true nature of the world hidden from the populace, but now the rhoa's out of the sack, and we'll keep both eyes open.`,
    `Or the one eye open, in my case.`,
    `Baran sent me letters.`,
    `He wrote that he was embarking on an expedition with Caeserius and several skilled exiles.`,
    `Kitava's temper tantrum kept me from Oriath, but my brother should have long since returned by now.`,
    `I know that searching for one man's brother is an inconsequential task for a Godslayer, but I have a bad feeling about this.`,
    `I knew I should have dropped everything and come back when he first wrote to me that he'd fallen in with that radical.`,
    `We'll find him.`,
    `Set this right.`,
    `He's in trouble, but he's got us looking out for him.`,
    `Use my skills.`,
    `With my help, you can track him down in no time.`,
    `You actually saw my brother? He's alive? Then finding his sanctuary is our next move.`,
    `It sounds like he's a bit out of sorts.`,
    `Let's continue to pursue him.`,
    `I just know that he can be saved, exile.`,
    `So that's it then.`,
    `Baran can't be saved.`,
    `Caeserius.`,
    `did she understand the costs? Did she know the fate she was consigning my brother to? I've no small bitterness over how far she went to try to save her father, yet here we are, abandoning my brother to eternal madness.`,
    `There's nothing to be done about it, but it still burns.`,
    `Zana Caeserius`,
    `If Caeserius is still alive, I'll track her down, and I'll deliver her in chains for judgement.`,
    `It's not for me to decide whether skulking around Oriath with mystical technologies that explode is a crime worthy of prison.`,
    `The new citizen Magistrates will handle that.`,
    `I intended to bring Caeserius to the Magistrates, but it sounds like Baran is in real trouble.`,
    `It runs at odds with my position in the Citizen Vanguard, but I think I've earned some discretion.`,
    `We should work with her until we rescue my brother.`,
    `Caeserius has a good head on her shoulders.`,
    `I'm starting to think her reputation as a radical is unearned.`,
    `By all accounts, regarding this 'Elder' creature she and her exiles defeated, she may have done Wraeclast a service, and nobody's the wiser.`,
    `Of course, that opinion hinges on whether they're telling the truth, and whether my brother can be saved.`,
    `In my heart, I do blame her for what happened to Baran.`,
    `If he was simply dead, that would be one thing, but he's out there suffering eternal madness because of her.`,
    `I can't deny that bitterness.`,
    `However, duty calls.`,
    `The people we've got are it.`,
    `If we tried to explain all this to the citizen Magistrates, Caeserius would be locked up for her associations with criminals, and we'd all be thrown in an asylum for our wild tales.`,
    `We must face this 'Sirus' together, all grievances aside.`,
    `Oriath`,
    `Seems enough was enough.`,
    `The Vanguard undertook the largest evacuation in history.`,
    `hundreds of ships.`,
    `and Oriath has been abandoned.`,
    `After the domination of the Templar, then the crackdown under Innocence, then the slaughter at Kitava's hands, and finally the ruination by Sirus, it's clear our little island is no place for men to live.`,
    `Even cursed, one could say, though we are not entirely blameless for those disasters.`,
    `No small irony that the Oriathan people now depend upon the Karui we once enslaved.`,
    `I always said that if you kick a rhoa in the arse, one day, it'll kick you in the head, but I underestimated the honour of our new hosts.`,
    `They're different after the death of their gods.`,
    `and we are, too, after the departure of ours.`,
    `I wasn't a believer, but I can feel it.`,
    `We're on our own now.`,
    `We're going to have to work together to face what comes next.`,
    `Karui Shores`,
    `Some say the Citizen Vanguard failed in its mission, but I say we succeeded, and wildly so.`,
    `Oriath may have been ruined, but its people will live on, because you and I were out there in the wild unknown facing dangers that would have destroyed all of Wraeclast otherwise.`,
    `Life in the Karui Archipelago will be tough, but we've been through worse many times over.`,
    `We'll be alright.`,
